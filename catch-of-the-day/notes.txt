Lesson 7
---------

sprops = args passed in to the component

$0 = in chrome etc dev tools - always the thing that's selected
(you can type these in the console to select what's selected by the browser)
$1 = next element 
$n etc.

$r = all the props that area available to the object (component) = all the args that've been passed to it   

Lesson 8
---------

stateless functional components = if your component just has a render method and prop types, it doesn't need to really *do* stuff it's just using templating kinda. this is vs. full components that have their own built-in methods etc.


Lesson 9
-------------

Routes - a separate, not part of default package like in node routing
-in routing we defined the URL schema where storeId is now a param inside that react component, so suddenly something can get passed from the browser URL into the app as a variable (See App > props > match > params > storeId)


Lesson 10
-------------

named exports:
import { specific funciton } from './FilePath';
which we can now use in our current file 
(ths is an alternative to importing the whole file and every function into it)

So methodology:
put helper functions in helpers.js and do that.
(Is it a react only thing or a JS thing that we're doing this?)
